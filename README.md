# Capstone-Project-1
## Blockchain Part - `blockchain_utils.py`

This file implements the core blockchain functionalities used in the project. It contains:

- **Block Structure**: Each block has index, timestamp, data, proof, and previous hash.
- **Proof of Work Algorithm**: Used to add difficulty and security to mining.
- **Blockchain Validation**: Ensures the integrity of the entire chain.
- **Block Hashing**: Generates SHA-256 hash of a block.

This part handles the logical structure and functioning of the blockchain used in our application.
